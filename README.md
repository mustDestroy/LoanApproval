# Loan Approval Prediction by Machine Learning

## 1. Scope of the project 🚀 
Delivering key insights to executive-driven business questions by applying ML models in the domain of finance e.g. for banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions.

**Business goals**:<br>
Woodgrove bank wants to gain in-depth insights from the representative financial data to finalize
the annual executive stakeholder report by the end of the current financial year.
The report deals with the yearly loan approval/rejection and has to find answers to:

- At which age group do the most people apply for loan at the bank?
- At which age group do the most people get loan from the bank?
- What's the ratio of getting loan at this age group?

Beyond the general business goals above, Woodgrove bank wants to speed up the evaluation of clients' creditworthiness to diminish the time and load. Furthermore, mitigate the creditworthiness to less than 10%.

**Business barriers**: <br>
- The data used for the evaluation contain too much information.
- The evaluation is not automated - clerks have to manually collect the data from different sources before starting the evaluation.
- Business data might redundant to some extent.

**The data analysis has to answer to**: <br>
- Which data is indispensable to make the evaluation correctly?
- Which data is negligible?
- What are the most impactful factors of approving loan applications? 

**Recommended solution**: <br>
I'm building an entire data processing pipeline for general financial data analysis.<br>
Along the pipeline I'm training ML models to estimate loan approval/rejection according to the accessible business data. <br>
The ML model will be able to evaluate clients' creditworthiness based on the entered data by them 
to avoid booking unnecessary appointment in brick-and-mortar bank branches to save time and effort.
